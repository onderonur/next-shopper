# next-shopper

This is a simple e-commerce web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), using React Server Components and Server Actions. The data is from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It is a really cool API to build e-commerce demo projects. Due to requirement to add some extra fields, its data is copied and changed a little.

**Live demo is [here](https://next-shopper.vercel.app/).**
